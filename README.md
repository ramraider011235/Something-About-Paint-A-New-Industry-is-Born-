## Initial Thoughts:



## Course Alteration via Data Assimulation:
  * MESS!
  * guy literally keyed in manually
  * added own formats char/symbols in random cells.

## RE-COLLECTED APPROACH:
  #### Simplify what Im looking At:
    1. import data from jumbled csv / pdf into python
    2. clean code to observable dataframes
    3. cross coorelate comprable aspects for visual representation.
    4. ![Time vs Day](images/paintcarelogo.png.png) 

  #### Had an Awkward Dataset to work with
    1. Oriented my focus toward comprehension of what was being represented by the numbers I did have.  

  ### Exploratory Analysis:
    1. Visualize What The Data and the story it told
  
## Narrowed Inquiry:
  1. What is the scope of the existing market and the company's position in relation?
  2. How is the company fairing vs itself over time
  3. What are trends that become apparant?
