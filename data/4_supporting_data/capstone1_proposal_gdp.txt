Topic: Local Business Creating A New Industry


	In the world of 2020 the call for going green has come to the forefront of nearly every industry with the consumer largely driving fundamental changes.  With this aspect becoming the norm it is vital companies adapt to manage rising expenses and operational costs to churn a profit.

	The company I selected is a local paint company with operations in Denver, CO and Seattle, WA.  The company positioned their enterprise within a massive natiional industry with the E.P.A. reporting 2.4 gallons of paint sold per US citizen.  Even at $10/gal. that is a $7.8 billion dollar industry with pleanty of market share to go around.  What sets this company apart from any other in operation is their business model.  This company has configured a method in which to recycle old used paint into new mid-grade paint that can be sold at a variety of retail locations including restore by habitat for humanity at $10-$15/gal.

This entity has managed to formulate this operation inline with recent legislation enacted in 11 states (CA, CO, CT, DC, ME, MN, NY, OR, RI, VT, WA). 3 states are presently in full operation with another 8 states implementing the program to roll out within the next 2 years.  There are another 20 states with intentions to put the measure on their state ballot within the next few years.  The PaintCare Act creates a small tax on the sale of paint to generate a fund for operational costs associated with recycling old/unused paint.  This is conducted by retailers instructing customers to return their old/unused paint to the local retailer.  Once the retailer’s crate is full they phone PaintCare who coordinates with a transportation company to pick the crate up and pays roughly $0.45/lb.  The transportation company not able to recycle the materials themselves partner with several organizations such as the one I have selected and splits the payment for removal/recycling.  As this company is the only one capable of recycling the product they have captured the lion’s share of the market averaging 57% since the program’s inception in 2015


    • Question: what is a reasonable forecast for the company’s growth potential? What can be their market share? Optimal ration of recycling &  producing?

    • DATA: I know an individual on the company’s board who has already provided me with the financials, production, sales, revenue, and historical data.

    • M.V.P: determine spectrum for likelihood of outcomes on %-of-paint-sold vs returned for recycling, company’s market share potential, production optimization, and profitability.  

    • M.V.P. +: determine scale-ability of the business factoring in new potential markets(states) and what operational capacity would be required to meet that demand and retain market share.
